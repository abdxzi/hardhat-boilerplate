# Sample Hardhat Project Boilerplate

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npm i
npx hardhat run ./scripts/[script.js] --network [NETWORK]

npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
